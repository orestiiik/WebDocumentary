          <h2>About Tamara R.</h2>
          <p>
            My name is Tamara Rabusicova and I am 20 years old. I am from Slovakia. After I got inspiration from my family members I decided to visit Medical High School. My mother and grandmother were nurses so that is where my inspiration came from. When I was deciding where to study next, I met my boyfriend. After a while, we started thinking about studying in Denmark. You may ask if I was 100% sure? No. Definitely not. I had a lot of questions regarding to programmes, study and housing. However, my biggest advantage was my boyfriendâ€™s sister. She used to study in Denmark for 5 years, so I had much information from right hand. After very bad experience with the student agency, when I was running out of energy and nerves, I could always write to her and ask whatever. She helped me a lot, and I very much wish to you, have such a person as I had, person who show you what real life is like, helps with the choice and final decision, sell information and knowledge. I find this decision as one of my best decisions of my life. As you could see above, I was studying Medical school and now I am here, on BAA currently studying Multimedia design. It was a really big difference between my study field and also I had zero experience with coding, and design. But it was exciting, thrilling and you should try this adventure as well as we all did.
