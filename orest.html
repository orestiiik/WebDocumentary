          <h2>About Orest G.</h2>
          <p>
            Hello! My name is Orest Gluch√Ω and I am getting pretty old with my 20 years old. I am from Slovakia where I studied electrical engineering at the best Slovakian school. I had subjects in the IT field but also in electrical engineering, I learned programming, databases, networking, technical drawing and much much more. Since I was a kid I was interested in computers and programming but also in travelling and meeting new people, that is why I choose to go to university abroad especially to Denmark cause I knew that a lot of my friends are interested in going to Denmark. I found a programme where I would be able to improve in subjects I already studied but also develop some new skills. That's why I chose Multimedia Design at BAA. I can improve my programming skills but also learn user experience and design. My biggest fear was coming to a place where I will know nobody but because people here are really friendly and helpful, that quickly changed. If you want to go abroad on a new life adventure and you want to be in a stressless, fun, helpful and friendly environment come and join us at BAA!
